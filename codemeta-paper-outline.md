#﻿CodeMeta vision paper


Target audience:
* Digital Repositories, Publishers, Information Science, Indexers?
* Software Developers


Intro (Matt, Mercè, Dan)
* What, Why, CodeMeta
* Why software is different than data
   * Conceptual differences: granularity/referencing, versioning, evolving contributor set
   * Metadata for software versus data
* Stakeholder audience(s)


Methodology (Matt, Mercè)
* Approach; workshop consensus
* Participants and the projects they represent
* Desiderata
* Guiding principles
   * Use driven
   * As simple as possible
   * Linkage to existing practices & repositories


Use cases (Carol, Ashley, Alice, Trisha)
* Key use cases
   * Who - User community/stakeholders involved in each use case[a][b]
   * What - what the use case is/what happens
* What is out of scope (e.g., workflow interop)


Concepts, map to use cases (Neil, Kyle, Trisha)




Examples of usage[c]
* Citation; Journals, SCWG linkage (example of principles in action) (Kyle)
* GitHub, Zenodo, figshare, DataCite integration (Krzysztof, Carl, Arfon)
   * Current implementation
* Software Discovery Dashboard work (MSL + RIT) (Peter, Luke, Abby)
   * Etherpad: https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/codemeta-sdd
* Project CReDiT
* Data Repository (domain, institutional) - DataCite integration (Matt, Mercè)
* CRAN, PyPI?


Next steps / Roadmap
* Priority Order
* Who / stakeholder responsible
   * Conclude for each stakeholder -- why you should care about and use this
* Open questions
[a]this needs a figure or table relating properties of use cases and relationship to stakeholders
[b]see https://github.com/force11/force11-scwg/blob/master/sc-principles/software-citation-principles.tex :)
[c]Might include examples from the JSON snippets.  Maybe a supplement with a fully worked example.
