Vision and Rationale
--------------------

<!--
- software is important
- infrastructure to archive/index/share/discover/attribute software is important (Is there a better way to say that?)
-->

Software developed by scientific researchers plays an already ubiquitous
and  ever increasing role in academic research, leading to increasing
recognition of the need for better mechanisms to _archive_, _index_,
_share_, _discover_ and _attribute_ research software. These needs impact
users, creators, and funders of this software. Researchers relying on
software need better mechanisms to discover and cite software they use.
Researchers creating software need a robust way to archive software
and track metrics of use. Funders supporting software creation are also
interested in ways to identify preserve, track, and measure the use of
software they have supported.  [@Hannay2009] find that 91.2% of
researchers state that using scientific software is important or very
important for their own research and 84.3% say developing software is
an important part of their own research. 54% spend more time developing
software now than in the decade prior, and 38% spend at least one fifth
of their time developing software.

<!-- Software is rarely archived, indexed or cited consistent with best practices -->

Despite this, software created by scientific researchers is rarely
archived, indexed or cited properly and consistent with best practices.
For instance, @Howison2015 find that citation practices
are "diverse and problematic." Their study finds that only 31%-43% of
the mentions of software in papers include a formal citation.
Formal citations are important not only because they provide more complete
information (the authors find most informal mentions acknowledge authors)
but also because tools used to compute citation metrics which play an
essential role in assessment of scholarly work typically apply only to
citations in a bibliography or references section of a paper.  The same
study reveals problems with access to the software that citations are
supposed to facilitate, with between 15%-29% of software mentioned being
inaccessible in any form.  Software may be inaccessible because the
citation does not provide enough information to identify it, because
the software is no longer available at the URL provided (preservation failure),
or because the software has never been made publicly available.
Moreover, the specific version of the software can be identified and
accessed in fewer than 10% of cases.  All of these issues arise not only
from behavior of authors using the software, but reflect issues in the
way in which software is archived and distributed.

<!-- Should we have more of a vision paragraph describing what would be possible? 
     (Makes the intro even longer; perhaps better left to proposal part...) -->

### Software Metadata Tower of Babble


<!-- Heterogeneity of practices contributes to this substantially. --> 

<!--
- Software is not archived with metadata appropriate for a citation.  (compare DOI)
- The software itself is frequently not archived
- Software indices use diverse formats  (authors, descriptions)
- Software languages use diverse formats (versions, dependencies, etc.) 
-->

Heterogeneity of practices in software archives contributes to
these issues in citing and accessing software.  In contrast to the
established practices of journal publication 
<!-- (which replaced far less effective practices of letters and anagrams 350 years ago) --> 
or the more nascent practices for data publication, the mechanisms to
archive, index, share, discover, and attribute research software remain
highly heterogeneous. Like journals and data repositories, indexes or
repositories for software can be specific to domains (e.g. Astrophysics
Source Code Library, ASCL), funder (DARPA Open Catalog) or conversely
rely on platforms also used for commercial software (GitHub, as used by
code.nasa.gov).  Yet while journals and data repositories adopt consistent
metadata that is aggregated and indexed (e.g. by CrossRef and DataCite,
as well as publishers like Thompson Reuters that compute impact factors
<!-- MBJ: I think this is arguable. Lots of heterogeneity in metadata for data too. -->
<!-- CB: True. What I'm trying to say is that a lot more of scientific data achiving has gotten behind the
idea of DataCite than software has-->
from citation information), no such infrastructure exists for software.
Indexes like the ASCL or DARPA Open Catalog do not necessarily archive
the software itself, making citations vulnerable to the inaccessibility
<!-- MBJ: nor do platform software repos. CRAN is not an archive -->
<!-- CB: Agree; should we mention them too?-->
found by @Howison2015. These indexes may not always specify
the specific version of the software, or, lacking an automated way to
track updates to software that is maintained at an external location, may
not reflect the most recent versions.  Software repositories frequently
omit other information necessary for reuse of the software, such as a
description of the software dependencies, computational environments,
or tests to ensure that the software is preforming properly.

Journal articles and data repositories handle heterogeneity of metadata
across their diverse repositories by mapping to common schema such as
the CrossRef and DataCite standards, or domain-specific metadata standards
such as ISO-19115.  This approach avoids many of the
above-mentioned problems afflicting software citation. Academic journals
and data repositories alike have settled on a widely recognized system
of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).  DOIs provide a way to avoid
link rot since the identifier can always be redirected to a new URL.
Journals or repositories that fail to do this can lose their license
to issue DOIs.  To receive a DOI that can be assigned to an article
or dataset, journals or repositories must provide the DOI registration
service (CrossRef for journals, DataCite for repositories) with minimal
metadata required for a citation.  Because this metadata is provided in
a standardized and searchable form, third party tools such as popular
reference management software (e.g. Endnote, Mendeley, Papers, Bibsonomy)
can automatically import the appropriate citation metadata given a DOI.
All of this substantially facilitates the process of providing complete
citations that can consistently access the resource cited. This kind
of interoperability is not possible in software archives which all use
different schema with no mapping among them.  While DataCite DOIs can
be issued to software archives by approved repositories, this system
is neither widely applied nor contains specific metadata required for
citations to software (such as version, licenses, or dependencies).

Even where DOIs have been assigned to software, the heterogeneity in
metadata practices frustrates their effectiveness.  The data repositories
figshare and Zenodo have recently worked in a project with the Mozilla
Science Lab and the software repository GitHub to create prototype
web-based tools that can automatically archive source code from GitHub
into Zenodo or figshare.  This creates an archival copy of the source
code, should the GitHub version ever be lost, and provides the code
with a registered DOI (as discussed in the NIH report on a software index
[http://softwarediscoveryindex.org/report](http://softwarediscoveryindex.org/report)).
Such automated tools sidestep the problem observed by @Allen2015 wherein
the expectation that a researcher will upload the software itself and not
just a description of the software is one that is often onerous enough to
dissuade researchers from archiving at all.  However, due to differences
in the schema used by each stakeholder, this process can be rather
incomplete and error prone.  For instance, while the GitHub metadata
can identify an overall project and all released versions associated
with that project in chronological order, Zenodo and figshare provide
no such way to represent the relationship between these versions, which
appear as completely separate entities, if they appear at all. This makes
it much more difficult to perform tasks like aggregating the number of
citations a software product has received across all versions. Incomplete
or inaccurate mappings also result in incorrect software licenses
being listed (e.g. in the figshare archive) or incorrect authors being
assigned. To address these issues, these repositories need both a robust
consensus on how terms should be mapped between the different schema,
and what holes exist in the current schema that prevent certain concepts
from being described at all.

<!-- Information required differs by use case -->

These differences and gaps in schema arise because different metadata
is required for different purposes. Thus this heterogeneity is not simply
a technical issue, but a cultural one which requires an understanding of 
each of the use cases that motivate the various metadata schema.  
At the most basic level, @Howison2015 observe that informal
mentions of software use only the name of the software, failing to
acknowledge the individuals who created it.  Identifying information
required by formal citations is only one use case for a software index.
We list other applications of software metadata in Table 1.
Some software indices such as the ASCL, code.nasa.gov or DARPA Open
Catalog provide additional fields useful for users searching for software
that fills a particular role by associating category or keyword terms with
each entry.  Meanwhile, a user actually seeking to install the software
needs to know what dependencies it has on other software, including
their versions.  A user seeking to modify or extend the software needs
access to the source code, as well as knowledge of what software license
governs its reuse.  As different users and different repositories have 
(often only implicitly) different use cases is mind, opinions differ as to
what metadata should be minimally sufficient for describing research software.


| Example uses for software metadata
| ----------------------------------
| Generate formal citations to software
| Download the software and documentation
| Determine what the software is supposed to do
| Determine software version to ensure reproducible results
| Discover newer or older versions of software for comparison
| Determine software license to assess reuse restrictions
| Determine the software dependencies / environment required
| Identify mechanisms to assess software quality
| Identify relevant software by keywords, subject categories, creator or other fields
| Identify citations and other metrics of software reuse

Table 1: Uses for software metadata

<!--
@ChueHong2014 identifies five different categories for software metadata

1. License: Determines the terms of reuse
2. Availability: Information related to the discovery and accessibility of the software
3. Quality: information describing what the software is supposed to do.  This may also include how to assess that it does what it is supposed to (e.g. unit tests)
4. Support: information describing how to install the software, dependencies, where to report bugs
5. Incentive: information on how to acknowledge the software, such as acknowledging developers, contributors, and providing a DOI

-->

<!-- The need for crosswalk between existing terms -->

Even when software repositories overlap in use cases, they represent the
same information using different formats and different vocabularies
(schema).  For instance, in different schema individuals may be
recognized as "author", or "creator", as well as more specific terms
such as "maintainer" or "contributor."  Automated tools require unambiguous
mappings between different versions of the same concept. 
Figure 1 illustrates 3 different metadata standards (R DESCRIPTION file,
Zenodo metadata, and DataCite metadata) that are used to describe the same
software product.  Differences in format and terms used in each creates
metadata loss as information is changed from one format to another.
Together, this heterogeneity in objectives and practices makes for a Tower of Babble of
software metadata.  This frustrates the development of user friendly tools
to aid in archiving and citing software, fragments community efforts, and
ultimately discourages researchers from investing greater effort to archive
or cite academic software.

## Proposal Objectives 

This proposal seeks to address these problems by bringing together
a collaboration of stakeholders in the software archive pipeline 
to harmonize their disparate approaches to software metadata. Work
will proceed in three phases. Phase 1 will build a crosswalk table among 
existing software metadata schemas.  In Phase 2, stakeholders will implement
changes to their existing software schemas and develop applications that take
advantage of the crosswalk table. In Phase 3, we will conduct a second workshop 
with domain scientists to assess outcomes and summarize
these outcomes in a scientific paper. Project milestones and deliverables
are summarized in Table 2 and described more fully below.

Table 2: Milestones and Deliverables

### Phase 1: Crosswalk Table

<!-- D1: draft table and use cases -->
Many metadata standards for software and other scholarly outputs already
exist. Examples include the Software Ontology [@malone_software_2014], 
the R Description file [@wickham_r_2015], and the DataCite Kernel Metadata
specification [@starr_iscitedby_2011], as well as more ad-hoc approaches such as the GitHub,
Zenodo, and Figshare metadata sets. Rather than define new standards, this group would define a
mapping between those standards already in place.  We will
bring together representatives from key software archiving infrastructure
(figshare, GitHub, DataONE, Zenodo, DataCite, EarthCube, the Software
Ontology, and other members from scientific communities of practice)
to design and implement a robust crosswalk of metadata
schema used by these communities.  A preliminary version can be found at
[github.com/mbjones/codemeta/blob/master/crosswalk.csv](https://github.com/mbjones/codemeta/blob/master/crosswalk.csv)

This mapping takes the form of a crosswalk table, where columns represent
schema in place by different repositories (GitHub, Zenodo, figshare
etc) and rows represent terms in the schema.  For instance, Zenodo
uses the term "creators" where figshare uses the term "authors." In
some cases this mapping will not be as trivial, for instance when it is
many-to-one (e.g. a schema that differentiates between "date published,"
"date created," or "date modified," vs simply having "date")
or when the analogous field is missing or not obvious (e.g. "code
repository" or "other versions", and "Funder ID" are not defined in
many schema). Consequently this mapping will ultimately rely on input
from the repositories to reach a community consensus on the
appropriate mappings.

The issue of gaps in the crosswalk table -- terms defined in one
schema with no obvious counterpart in another schema -- raises a more
challenging problem.  Different schema have been created to facilitate
different uses, and determining exactly what terms must be included
is a more difficult challenge, similar to the well-recognized problem
of creating new standards.  To avoid this issue and facilitate dialog,
this group will instead focus on identifying and enumerating the _use
cases_ associated with different sets of metadata.  For instance, the
use case of "scientific citation" requires metadata fields which are
common to most schema: such as _creator_, _date_, _title_ and so forth,
while the use case of installing the software requires different fields
such as "software dependencies" that are far less common and less well
standardized. Associating metadata fields with use cases will help guide
the process of identifying what gaps in schema should be addressed and
what gaps merely reflect different use case objectives of different
schema. 

<!-- D2: Schema  -->
Once the crosswalk table has been defined conceptually, it is necessary to
have a machine-readable representation of this information which will enable
tool development, which we will refer to as a "schema" for the crosswalk
table. This schema must be rich enough to capture the diverse terms of different
stakeholders, including the potential for formal semantic representations (e.g., the Software Ontology [@malone_software_2014])
while also being in a format that is easily integrated into existing tools.
A JSON-LD format is probably most suitable for this role, as discussed in
more detail here:
[http://www.arfon.org/json-ld-for-software-discovery-reuse-and-credit](http://www.arfon.org/json-ld-for-software-discovery-reuse-and-credit)

<!-- D3: meeting -->
To catalyze this process, we will organize a three-day meeting in
Spring of 2016 in Berkeley, CA to bring together 10-15 stakeholders
and agree upon the crosswalk table terms and categories (Deliverable
D3, in Table 2). The supporting material includes letters of collaboration
from already-committed stakeholders to attend the meeting. We will present participants with a draft version of
the crosswalk table (D1) that we develop in the months prior to the
meeting to help focus discussion on concrete outcomes. Likewse, we will
present stakeholders with a draft of the machine-readable format (schema) for
representing this crosswalk table (D2). Both this crosswalk table and 
the machine-readable schema represention will be refined at the meeting into 
products that represent the needs and consensus of these stakeholders
(D4, D5). 

The consensus crosswalk table will be published on GitHub where participants and other
stakeholders can critique, revise, and propose further extensions with
other schema. Once in place, the crosswalk table could be extended to include terms
from other repositories.  In particular, this could include repositories
developed for specific computer languages such as the `DESCRIPTION` files
associated with R packages on the Central R Archive Network (CRAN), which
include many of the same fields. 

**Deliverables**: D1: Draft software metadata use cases and 
crosswalk table; D2: Draft JSON-LD schema expressing consensus software metadata concepts and crosswalk (codemeta.json); D3: Software metadata crosswalk workshop; D4: Consensus crosswalk table; D5: Consensus 
JSON-LD schema for software metadata.

### Phase 2: Implementation by Repositories

Each of the repositories participating in this proposal would then be
able to extend their existing schema accordingly to ensure they have
implemented the metadata necessary for the use cases they intend to
support. It is in this phase that stakeholders may add or modify fields
associated with gaps in their schema that need to be addressed to fulfill
a given use case. Several key
stakeholders have already committed to participating in the meeting and
implementing any necessary changes in their schema that arise as a result,
including: the software repository GitHub and the data repositories
Zenodo, figshare, and the KNB.  By modifying their existing schema to
bridge gaps in the crosswalk table, these stakeholders will enable a
much more robust system for software archiving and interchange than is
currently available.

<!--CB: Not sure if this section belongs here? Maybe some of this belongs in the DataONE section above-->
Provenance and computational replicability represent some of the
more advanced but critically important use cases for archiving and
describing software.  Current data repository efforts such as DataONE and
Dryad support archiving specific versions of data and associating them
with published manuscripts, but the infrastructure for doing the same
with software is in its infancy.  Archiving code intended for reuse is
very different from archiving most of the code that scientists write to
calculate results in papers, which are typically one-off scripts and codes
targeting a specific science problem.  GitHub, CRAN, PyPI, and similar
repositories focus on sharing re-usable code, but not so much one-off
code.  The R CRAN maintainers would outright reject the vast majority
of scientific code written, as it would be deemed unsuitable for reuse.
However, it reflects reality as we know it, and it would be useful
for people trying to understand a paper, regardless of its condition.
Data repositories like the KNB are starting to offer code archiving and
snapshotting.  Research software intended for reuse by other researchers
in the context of other scientific questions presents a different problem
than such one-off scripts, as it typically continues to evolve after it is
first released, and the archived version quickly becomes stale. Automatic
integration between GitHub and the data repositories could remedy this
issue by continuing to import future versions of the software on the data
repository whenever a new release is created on the GitHub repository,
without requiring any human intervention.  This trigger system is already
implemented in the link between GitHub and Zenodo, but is less effective
than it might be as Zenodo does not currently track the relationships
between these versions. 

<!-- DataONE implementation -->
The NSF-sponsored DataONE federation of repositories, including the KNB Data Repository, 
provide archival services for both data and software, but with relatively minimal metadata for software.
During this phase, we will focus on adjusting the software metadata used in the DataONE
network to reflect the consensus crosswalk table (D6), and enable its use to describe
all scientific software, including both one-off and software built for reuse.
This would provide all data repositories in the DataONE network with a standard
format in which to capture software metadata that would interoperate with other community
repositories such as FigShare and Zenodo. To facilitate the use of this metadata
format, we would extend the `dataone` R package to allow users to automatically
upload software and appropriate metadata to the KNB, a member data repository 
in the DataONE network (D7). The DataONE network is already working towards
collecting and saving provenance information regarding scientific processes, and
a robust software metadata model will strengthen this work. This application would 
serve as a prototype to both illustrate and test how robust software archiving can 
be facilitated by such tools.
<!-- MBJ: This seems adequate to me.  I could give some examples, but that would
     just take space, and it seems we are already significantly over length.  Let's discuss. -->

<!-- Unfunded stakeholders implementation -->
GitHub, Zenodo, and figshare intend to revisit their current
implementations of the tools that allow a user to import software from
GitHub into one of the data repositories and assign it a DOI.  By making
use of the crosswalk table, this import process can avoid losing or
inconsistently mapping metadata fields.  In certain places this may also
involve adjusting existing schema used by the stakeholders to avoid gaps
where metadata required by a desired use case is currently being lost.
While this work will be taken on by individual stakeholders and not
directly supported through this proposal funding, we will summarize
what changes result from these activities (D8).

#### Tools to identify and aggregate citations to software

We will also develop a prototype tool to provide an aggregated view of software usage and citation, 
building upon the existing work done for data citation by the recent 
NSF-EAGER-supported project "Making Data Count,"
[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9kf081vf](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9kf081vf).

Measuring the impact of research software through citations is essential
to both crediting and incentivizing software sharing and archiving,
just as it is for data and journal publications.  However, accurately
counting citations to software is particularly problematic due to the
heterogeneous and problematic citation practices observed in @Howison2015.
Complete and consistent metadata is essential for
aggregating heterogeneous citation practices into proper citation counts.
For instance, some formal citations cite only a journal article that
describes the software, while others cite the software itself. Still
more cite the software only by name. Metadata that associate the software
name, related versions, and related publications to a unique identifier
for a given piece of software is thus necessary to tabulate citations.
To illustrate the value of the crosswalk table and implementations
described above to addressing the problem of software citation, we
will extend data usage and citation metrics to the software world by
building on the "Making Data Count" project,
[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9kf081vf](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9kf081vf).
This work would involve configuring Lagotto's indexing engine to detect software
as well as data and articles as it scans through existing corpora of work, and
then indexing those software usage events as it does for data and articles (D9).

**Deliverables** D6: Implementation of crosswalk metadata in DataONE. D7: Implementation
of an R-based software package that would assist researchers in uploading software or
code scripts to the KNB data repository. D8: A description of the implementations and 
adjustments made by participating stakeholders to their existing infrastructure. 
D9: Software usage and citation metrics tracking extending Lagotto.


### Phase 3: Assessment and Communication

Project assessment and communication will be carried out through three
main mechanisms. First, we will maintain a public list of project
milestones through the project GitHub repository's milestone tracker system (D10).
This will allow participants and other members of the community to view 
progress and comment on issues related to any one of the milestones summarized
in Table 2. This list shall be maintained throughout the project duration.  
It will also provide a mechanism for open community participation in the project.

Second, we will conduct a formal usability evaluation workshop with domain 
scientists (D11). We will invite usability study experts from the DataONE
Usability and Assessment working group to help design and run this workshop, as
it closely aligns with the DataONE provenance tracking initiatives.
The assessment will focus on conceptual understanding of domain
researchers needs for software metadta. We will
gather feedback on the utility of our overall approach to software citation 
and software discovery in research, as well as the specific use cases and metadata 
content identified in Phase I. We will also have researchers evaluate the prototype
software upload tools from Phase II. This will help us assess how these prototypes are likely
to impact individual researchers and how they discover, use, archive, and cite 
software.  Due to the short 1 year timeline of the project, this workshop will focus on
usability of the crosswalk table and prototype tools created during the EAGER, rather than
usage and uptake which would not be appropriate to measure over such a short timeline. 
This workshop would be held in a 1/2 day
session at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America in August of 2016, to 
help ensure participation of domain researchers who use or create software
in the course of their research.

Finally, all project outcomes, including the results of this assessment,
will be reported in a scientific publication at the end of the project period (D12).
This would help communicate the consensus reached by stakeholders in 
creating the crosswalk table, as well as highlighting the outcomes from the various
applications implemented in Phase 2 and the experience of the assessment workshop.

## Project Management Plan

This project will be led by PI Boettiger at UC Berkeley. Collaborators are uniquely suited
to realize this project due to their involvement in key community software and data
archival initiatives, including Co-PI Jones at UC Santa Barbara (DataONE), Arfon Smith (GitHub), 
Lars Holm Nielsen (Zenodo), Mark Hahnel (Figshare), and Martin Fenner (PLOS). These 
individuals will act as the project leadership team to guide all development work 
to completion of stated milestones. The project will be  implemented in three phases over 1 year 
starting in October, 2015 as outlined in Table 2 and the main body above, with 
the intent that each phase builds upon the previous.

Project tasks will be recorded in a GitHub issue tracking repository and used to
record all activities of project participants, as well as coordinate with the 
broader community.  All project software and artifacts will also be made available
through GitHub or another open repository under an OSI-approved open source license
such as the `Apache 2` license.  See the Data Management plans for further details.

## Broader Impacts

<!-- not sure what format this should take. Probably scrap the bullets points -->

- Other software indexes or repositories could adopt and extend the
crosswalk table
- Promote the development of an ecosystem of tools for working with
software metadata
- Funders could more easily track software they support
- Researchers could more easily archive software completely and
accurately.
- Citations to software archived in this way would be more useful

The crosswalk table would provide a valuable resource for other software
repositories and indices even if they are not directly involved in its
creation.  By mapping their own schema to any one of the repositories
represented in the crosswalk table they would immediately have a
mapping to all others.  Likewise, this would help make such repositories
interoperable with any applications built around the crosswalk table.
Additional mappings could be proposed as Pull Requests to the crosswalk
table.

In addition to the example applications proposed as part of this
proposal, the existence of the crosswalk table would facilitate the
development of further applications that require such metadata.
For instance, tools to compute "Transitive Credit" [Katz & Smith
2014](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5117) could be built around the citation
or software dependencies lists of different software as expressed in
the crosswalk table.  A machine readable and software-language-agnostic
representation of dependencies provided by this metadata could be used
to write a script that automatically provisions a virtual machine
or container with the dependencies required for the software to execute.
For a language-specific proof-of-concept, see https://github.com/richfitz/dockertest 


Including identifiers for the funder and possibly grant supporting the
software would enable programmatic identification of any software products
associated with a particular funder, as well as tracking future versions,
citations, or other metrics of use of that software.

Researchers generating software would benefit from the more streamlined
and accurate metadata made possible by the crosswalk table and tools such
as the automated detection of software metadata for specific languages
and the improved pipeline for assigning DOIs to software on GitHub
through integration with data repositories.

Researchers could cite such software using it's DOI.  Many popular
authoring platforms can automatically fill in citation information given
a DOI (EndNote, Papers, Mendeley, Bibsonomy), making citation easier
and more accurate.  Readers looking up a citation would have access to
the source code and richer description of the software, potentially
including information about dependencies and related works such as
published articles describing the software. Consistent citing patterns
through the use of a DOI would also facilitate tabulating citations.
